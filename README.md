# RetailSalesDataAnalysis

The project was to analysis the business year sales data to discover possible trend, identity any potential issue that may affected sale performance in the year, provide answers to some business questions regarding the data and finally give recommendation on how to improve sales performance which will assist the business managers to make strategic data driven decision.

The data was collected directly for transactions between 1st January 2023 till 31st December 2023 from Microsoft SQL Server using SQL commands from relevant table objects and exported into Microsoft excel for further analysis using tables, functions for data manipulation, Pivot table and charts to virtualize insight generated to address or answer the business questions. Then, all the charts were pinned together on a dashboard for a quicker understanding of the data.

The highest sales record in year was 53,150.00 and the lowest was 23,620.00, which happen in the month of May and September respectively. Also, a steady growth in sales was observed from March till May and a consistent drop in sales afterwards from Jun to July. In addition, a spike in sales of electronics in May and December coincides with the sales promotion and the festive period respectively.
 
Conclusively, the impact on the sales promotion in the year was positive and the spending habit of customers increases during the festive period. These can be transferred into actionable steps towards better strategic planning to improve sales in the coming year.
